## About <a name = "about"></a>

  An open source project for Codecool.
  As students on the 4th and last learning module in Codecool we are creating an open source web application using tools and knowledge we have gained during the course. Virtual-Stylist is an application which can help you manage your wardrobe, group and store every piece of clothing you have. Moreover, we offer our stylist module which is able to create stylizations for different occasions. You can also use clothes in your wardrobe to create and save your own stylization.
